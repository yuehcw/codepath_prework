## Notes

One of the main challenges encountered while building the app was ensuring smooth integration between the front-end and back-end, especially when managing real-time updates for content creator data. Additionally, implementing user permissions for adding, editing, and deleting content creators required careful planning to maintain data integrity and security. Balancing usability with these technical considerations was key to delivering a seamless user experience.
